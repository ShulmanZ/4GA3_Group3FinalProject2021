## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggmap)
library(geosphere)
library(sf)
library(plotly)
library(spdep)
library(geog4ga3)
```

```{r}
#This is the code we will be using throughout this entire project
#Use this

#Group Names:
#Zack
#Devon
#Ignacio
#Owen
#Lysha


library(readr)
ProjectVariables_Final <- read_excel("4GA3_Project_Variables_Final.xlsx")
Neighbourbounds <- st_read("Neighbourhoods")
Parks <- st_read("parks-wgs84")
plot(st_geometry(Neighbourbounds))
plot(st_geometry(Parks))



```
